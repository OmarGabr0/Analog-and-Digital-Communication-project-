Implementation a MATLAB code that takes an arbitrary number of signals as an input (M signals) 
and uses Gram-Schmidt procedure to produce the minimum number of required orthonormal 
basis functions (N bases function) to represent the M signals. Using constellation diagram to 
calculate the probability of errors in the system practically

#part1 
1. Plot the M input signals, and the N basis functions

2. Plot the constellation diagram of the signals.

3. Calculate the energy of each symbols using the constellation diagram.

4. Test your code using the two following sets of signals and document the results.

#part2
1. Use the code in part 1 to plot the constellation diagram of binary polar NRZ 
system.

2. Generate 100000 random stream of bits and encode them using polar NRZ

3. Transmit the encoded data through AWGN channel with different noise power 
levels, and sketch the constellation the of received signal at the output of the 
channel. Assume 𝐸𝑏/𝑁𝑜 takes values = {-10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 dB} (Eb is the energy 
per bit & 𝑁𝑜

4. Decode the received data plot the relation between the BER of decoded data and 𝐸𝑏/𝑁𝑜. 

5. Derive theoretically the BER of polar NRZ in terms of 𝐸𝑏/𝑁𝑜
and plot the theoretical BER vs 𝐸𝑏/𝑁𝑜 in dB and compare it with the results from part 4 on the same curve. 
Comment on the results.
